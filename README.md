## Description
*djlokal* is an emerging business that seeks to consolidate the local party scene. Our company operates as a regional party platform, providing a centralized hub for event planners, local venues, and DJs. We aim to simplify the party planning process by offering a single platform that showcases upcoming events, available locations, and DJs based on their preferred genres. Moreover, we facilitate communication between event planners and venues, and we encourage feedback to enhance the overall party experience. Our future plans involve expanding the platform to cover multiple regions and further centralize the party scene.

## Business activities
- **Centralize the local party scene**:
Our organisation is an upcoming regional party platform. Local loctions and DJ’s should get the
opportunity to introduce themself into the party scene to get some traffic. While nowadays each club
has it’s own website and has to do researching for DJ’s and overlapping events we want to make this
centralized on one certain platform. This platform should show any upcoming events, show locations
where events could be planned and show DJ’s with their preferred genre so event planner can search
for their prioritized options.

- **Enable communication of locations and people who want to do an event**:
Locations should show if they can be accessible for a potential event so event planner can contact
them if they are interested.

- **Improve the party scene with feedback options**
We want to improve the scene while providing a feedback service to comment every event, location,
DJ or different constellations of the three parts. The feedback should show the event planner what
they can do better. Locations should see if they can improve their setting or remove bad things.

- **Future work**
In the future we think about expanding this platform or create one for each region to centralize the
party scene even more in one place or in each region.
